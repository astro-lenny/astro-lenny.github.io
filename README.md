# Welcome
- 👋 Hi, I’m Lennart. I studied Astrophysics at the University of Bonn, Germany.
- 📫 How to reach me: [mail(...at...)lennart-boehm.de](mailto:mail@lennart-boehm.de)
- 👀 I’m interested in the ISM 🌌, especially star-forming regions and molecular clouds 🌥️, high mass star formation and astrochemistry 🧑‍🔬.
- 🧑‍💻 In my bachelor thesis, I investigated the origin of counter-rotating stars in simulated galaxies.
- 🎓 I studied astrophysics at the University of Bonn, then moved to observational studies...
- 📡 and am currently working on the role of hydrogen chloride (HCl) 🧪 in star-forming regions.
- 👉 Here are my [🌐 website](https://lennart-boehm.de), my [🧑‍💼 LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourusername](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennart-boehm/)) and my [🧑‍💻 GitHub](https://github.com/astro-lenny).
